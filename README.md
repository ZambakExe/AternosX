## FAQ ‚ùì

## How to fix `unsupported/unknown protocol version: ###, update minecraft-data`?

```bash
This project is using the `mineflayer` module.  
It may not supported on your server version yet.
I'm trying to periodically check for updates, so please be patient.
```
## My bot leaves permanently after n hours.


```bash
Aternos automatically bans AFK players from your server.
So just unban your bot, if it's banned.
```
## How to fix Invalid move player packet received?

```bash
It seems your bot escaped from the bedrock room.    
So you have to wipe the playerdata in your server.  
1. Go to the management page of your Aternos server.
2. Click `Files` in the left section.
3. Delete the `world/playerdata/<UUID>.dat`, `<UUID>.dat_old` file. (the UUID is your bot's UUID)
4. Restart the bot.
```
